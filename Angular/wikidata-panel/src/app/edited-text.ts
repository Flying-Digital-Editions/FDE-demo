export const testo1 = "It was the ancient opinion of not a few, in the earliest ages of philosophy, that the fixed stars stood immoveable in the highest parts of the world; that under the fixed stars the planets were carried about the Sun; that the Earth, as one of the planets, described an annual course about the sun, while by a diurnal motion it was in the mean time revolved about its own axis; and that the sun, as the common fire which served to warm the whole, was fixed in the centre of the universe. This was the philosophy taught of old by Philolaus, Aristarchus of Samos, Plato in his riper years, and the whole sect of the Pythagoreans; and this was the judgment of Anaximander, more ancient than any of them; and of that wise king of the Romans, Numa Pompilius, who, as a symbol of the figure of the world with the sun in the centre, erected a temple in honour of Vesta, of a round form, and ordained perpetual fire to be kept in the middle of it. The Egyptians were early observers of the heavens; and from them, probably, this philosophy was spread abroad among other nations; for from them it was, and the nations about them, that the Greeks, a people of themselves more addicted to the study of philology than of nature, derived their first, as well as soundest, notions of philosophy; and in the vestal ceremonies we may yet trace the ancient spirit of the Egyptians; for it was their way to deliver their mysteries, that is, their philosophy of things above the vulgar way of thinking, under the veil of religious rites and hieroglyphic symbols. It is not to be denied but that Anaxagoras, Democritus, and others, did now and then start up, who would have it that the earth possessed the centre of the world, and that the stars of all sorts were revolved towards the west about the earth quiescent in the centre, some at a swifter, others at a slower rate. However, it was agreed on both sides that the motions of the celestial bodies were performed in spaces altogether free and void of resistance. The whim of solid orbs was of a later date, introduced by Eudoxus, Calippus, and Aristotle; when the ancient philosophy began to decline, and to give place to the new prevailing fictions of the Greeks.";

export const testo2 = "Huge, Massive, Mega, Gargantuan. These are the words that barely begin to describe the most massive stars in the universe. Let's start with the familiar and take it from there. We all know and love the Sun, it gives us light, energy and life. Without it, we would not exist and life as we know it could not occur. Yet it isn't the biggest of stars, in fact it is only a mid-sized main sequence star. The Sun is - on the cosmic scale - a rather regular and boring star, which is good for us as it gives stability and great temperatures where liquid water and thus life can occur. Let's look at what is normal and build upwards from there. Below is a diagram known as the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. It is the main tool used to map most stars given their size, luminosity and mass. We can even see the position of the Sun which is slightly below and to the right of the center of the diagram. Generally as we go up and to the left, the pattern of main sequence stars (that slash through the middle of the diagram) shows larger blue stars which have a large luminosity (the amount of light they put out) and higher surface temperature. They also tend to be bigger. More light, generally means a larger amount of matter in the star. An example of a large main sequence star is Mu Columbae. This star is a star in the constellation Columba. It is a naked eye blue star which means that if you are lucky enough to look the right way, then you might be able to see it in the night sky. It has a mass of approximately 16 solar masses which means that it is approximately 45,000 solar luminosities. So it is 45,000 brighter than the Sun. While this is not necessarily the biggest blue star in our galaxy, it is a good example of what possible values come from the largest of main sequence (MS) stars.  These blue MS stars are able to produce the heavy elements in our universe which are beyond Carbon, beyond Oxygen and on to heavier elements like metals all the way up to Iron. They do this using the immense pressure in their core and the process of stellar nucleosynthesis which couples with quantum tunneling and leads to incredible and complicated fusion processes. The rest of the elements which are heavier and more dense than Iron are made during the supernovae process caused by the dying of these large stars. Any element beyond Iron which is element 26 is made by the dying of these large main sequence stars. Elements such as Copper, Gold, Lead, Iodine etc. all come from those stellar sized explosions. This is what makes the blue MS stars the elemental engines that they are. Without that immense size and pressure from all the matter above, the core would not be able to perform its job of producing enough energy and heavier products - through fusion - to sustain the core. The strong gravity from all the matter in the massive star is balanced by all the energy output pushing outwards from the core of the star. While the largest blue MS stars are large indeed and they give us many of the heavier elements that we know, rely upon and use everyday. These are not the largest stars, they are actually far from it. If, as this sub-title suggests, we move beyond the main sequence, there are supergiants which you can see at the top of Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. These can be larger in size than main sequence stars. Rigel for example is a blue supergiant star and has a mass of about 18 Suns and has a luminosity which is 47,000 times that of the Sun. You might notice that there is an overlap between the largest main sequence stars and blue supergiants and there is indeed comparison in size. Yet, the truly largest and biggest stars belong in a category all of their own. Hypergiants, the largest stars in the galaxy (and likely all galaxies) have incredible size and scale. These beasts range in size massively, but reach to the absolutely largest of stars. Some comparisons here help show the scale of them below. The stars shown on the right are VY Canis Major (most right), then VY Cephi, WOH G64. They are all red hyper-giants. In this image, a single pixel represents the size of the entire Sun. The largest star that we currently know of and is universally accepted is UV Scuti. This unbelievably massive star has rather insane and incredible characteristics that are difficult to understand how it has puffed up so much. UV Scuti has a diameter that is 1,700 times larger than that of the Sun. The diameter is approximately 2.4 billion kilometers. If UY Scuti were placed where the Sun currently sits, its outer layers would extend all the way to the orbit of Jupiter. Now that is an unfathomable size! Interestingly since UY Scuti has puffy properties and the layering in the star is extended, this star only has an estimated mass of 7 to 10 Solar masses. While it is the largest star we know of, it is not actually the most massive. That honor belongs to R136c, the mass values are estimated to be between 170 to 230 solar masses. Regardless of the definite number, it is truly a colossal star with epically massive proportions. This star is so incredibly massive that it is difficult for it to keep sustained fusion because when it starts fusion it throws off its outer layers before they are brought back by gravity and the star starts fusion again. Understanding what dynamics the largest stars have inside of them is an intriguing puzzle and can give us new insight into fusion and the limits of what is possible for stars in our universe. I hope you have enjoyed the above and perhaps learning something new.";

export const testo3 = "July 1969. It's a little over eight years since the flights of Gagarin and Shepard, followed quickly by President Kennedy's challenge to put a man on the moon before the decade is out. It is only seven months since NASA's made a bold decision to send Apollo 8 all the way to the moon on the first manned flight of the massive Saturn V rocket. Now, on the morning of July 16, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins sit atop another Saturn V at Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center. The three-stage 363-foot rocket will use its 7.5 million pounds of thrust to propel them into space and into history. At 9:32 a.m. EDT, the engines fire and Apollo 11 clears the tower. About 12 minutes later, the crew is in Earth orbit. After one and a half orbits, Apollo 11 gets a 'go' for what mission controllers call 'Translunar Injection' - in other words, it's time to head for the moon. Three days later the crew is in lunar orbit. A day after that, Armstrong and Aldrin climb into the lunar module Eagle and begin the descent, while Collins orbits in the command module Columbia. Collins later writes that Eagle is 'the weirdest looking contraption I have ever seen in the sky,' but it will prove its worth. When it comes time to set Eagle down in the Sea of Tranquility, Armstrong improvises, manually piloting the ship past an area littered with boulders. During the final seconds of descent, Eagle's computer is sounding alarms. It turns out to be a simple case of the computer trying to do too many things at once, but as Aldrin will later point out, 'unfortunately it came up when we did not want to be trying to solve these particular problems.' When the lunar module lands at 4:17 p.m EDT, only 30 seconds of fuel remain. Armstrong radios 'Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.' Mission control erupts in celebration as the tension breaks, and a controller tells the crew 'You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, we're breathing again.' Armstrong will later confirm that landing was his biggest concern, saying 'the unknowns were rampant,' and 'there were just a thousand things to worry about.' At 10:56 p.m. EDT Armstrong is ready to plant the first human foot on another world. With more than half a billion people watching on television, he climbs down the ladder and proclaims: 'That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.' Aldrin joins him shortly, and offers a simple but powerful description of the lunar surface: 'magnificent desolation.' They explore the surface for two and a half hours, collecting samples and taking photographs. They leave behind an American flag, a patch honoring the fallen Apollo 1 crew, and a plaque on one of Eagle's legs. It reads, 'Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon. July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.' Armstrong and Aldrin blast off and dock with Collins in Columbia. Collins later says that 'for the first time' he 'really felt that we were going to carry this thing off.' The crew splashes down off Hawaii on July 24. Kennedy's challenge has been met. Men from Earth have walked on the moon and returned safely home. In an interview years later, Armstrong praises the 'hundreds of thousands' of people behind the project. 'Every guy that's setting up the tests, cranking the torque wrench, and so on, is saying, man or woman, 'If anything goes wrong here, it's not going to be my fault.’ In a post-flight press conference, Armstrong calls the flight 'a beginning of a new age,' while Collins talks about future journeys to Mars. Over the next three and a half years, 10 astronauts will follow in their footsteps. Gene Cernan, commander of the last Apollo mission leaves the lunar surface with these words: 'We leave as we came and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace, and hope for all mankind.'"
